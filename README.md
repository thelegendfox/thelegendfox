——> — hallo. i'm the one-and-only legendfox. just "fox" is good. don't call me Legend, though.<br/>
— just learning to code. suggestions are appreciated, as is *constructive* critisism. <br/>
— what am i learning? the odin project's thing right now. i'm in the beginning, though.<br/>
— reach me via (currently nothing, but i'll have some links here eventually.)<br/>
— since i've been prompted about it, just call me `they/them`. if otherwise indicated, call me that.<br/>
— quite jaded all of the time, so if i'm not nice, then i'm sorry, it's not personal.
